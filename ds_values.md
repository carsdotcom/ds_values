i.  **Ethics**: Maintain *Data Ethics* while performing any reporting,
    analysis and machine learning work which means preserving privacy of
    a user. Beware of legal terms and conditions of using any
    third-party data. From an algorithm point of view, it involves
    avoiding bias in it and being conscious of it, ex: using zip code in
    a predictive model will likely introduce racial bias similarly using
    names will introduce gender bias.

Recommended reading materials: [Ethics and Data
Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41543548-ethics-and-data-science)
and [Weapons of Math
Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction).

ii. **Democratization**: Democratize ML by socializing data science
    across all functions of Cars.com by continuous improvement in
    model\'s interpretability, building interactive dashboards,
    presentation materials and machine learning products. This means
    making data science easily accessible to non-technical colleagues by
    training/mentoring then on data analytics and sciences skills.

iii. **Culture**: Data, science and logic shall be put first in every
    decision and policy making and strategy building process, big or
    small.

iv. **Curiosity and Science**: The job of a data scientist is not only
    to ask the right questions and challenge hidden assumptions but also
    use scientific methods to answer and verify them.

v.  **Bias**: Be conscious of inherent 'bias' in the data, sampling of
    the data, data collection framework, potentially flawed analytical
    framework. Use the term 'bias' while being aware of the context.
    Find new ways to deal with it and educate business partners on the
    business trade-offs of having a biased system versus a less biased
    system.

vi. **ML minded product and product minded ML**: Work transparently with
    product teams, strive for feedback loop-based control systems for
    all derived solutions.

vii. Excel at building highly predictable, rigid (stable),
    multiapplication\* and scalable Machine Learning (ML) models.

viii. **Embrace Change**: Actively embrace, while also challenging the
    industry and thought leaders and best practices.

ix. **Product, DS and Engineering**: Collaborate with the data products,
    ML platform and engineering teams to operationalize Data Science.
    It's essential to be a good team player in a tech company to
    champion building successful products.

**Note**: These principles are also recommended for data professionals that
include data product managers, data engineers and leaders in the space,
data scientists, ML and AI Software Developers.
